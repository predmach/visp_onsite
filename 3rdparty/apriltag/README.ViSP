Porting of the AprilTag library: https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html
AprilTag version is 2016-12-01 (0.9.8).

Changes / modifications made:
  - scale directly the pose computed in homography_to_pose() (homography.c)
    by the marker size
  - we observed that the pose returned by homography_to_pose() is left-handed,
    we add a transformation to get a right-handed pose

Windows porting (MinGW):
  - see commit 4f5d150 and previous
  - use C99 flag
  - replace srandom and random by srand and rand
  - replacement for <sys/time.h>, see https://www.codefull.org/2015/12/systime-h-replacement-for-windows/
  - replacement for getline() function, see here https://stackoverflow.com/a/735472

Windows porting (MSVC):
  - see commit 8bf0b87
  - see MinGW porting
  - build AprilTag with pthreads-win32 (https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/)
  - replace variable-length array in C99 by malloc as Visual Studio does not conform to C99
  - replace some missing posix functions or constants

Windows UWP porting (MSVC):
  - remove functions that are using missing win32 functions not available on UWP (see #ifdef WINRT and #ifndef WINRT)

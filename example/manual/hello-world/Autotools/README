                "Hello World" example based on Autotools


This example shows how to exploit the ViSP library to build the "Hello World"
example based on Autotools build tools.

Prior to use ViSP as a third party library you need a compiled (build) version
of ViSP source code. We suppose here that ViSP is build in <visp_build_dir>. 
ViSP library is than in <visp_build_dir>/lib/libvisp.[a,so,lib,dll].

To configure this project using ViSP as a third party library, type:

aclocal -I .
touch NEWS AUTHORS ChangeLog
automake -a
autoconf
./configure --with-visp-install-bin=<visp_build_dir>/bin

Now you can compile this project by:

make

That's all

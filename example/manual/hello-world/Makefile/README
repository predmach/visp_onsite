                "Hello World" example based on Makefiles


This example shows how to exploit the ViSP library to build the "Hello World"
example based on Makefiles build tools.

Prior to use ViSP as a third party library you need a compiled (build) version
of ViSP source code. We suppose here that ViSP is build in <visp_build_dir>. 
ViSP library is than in <visp_build_dir>/lib/libvisp.[a,so,lib,dll].

To build this project using ViSP as a third party library, you need first 
to edit the Makefile file in order to set the VISP_BUILD_DIR variable to 
<visp_build_dir> location.

Than you can compile this project by:

make

That's all
